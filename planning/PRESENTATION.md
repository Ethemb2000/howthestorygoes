# WHO'S SCREEN?

- David

# INTRODUCTIONS

- 1st - Keagan

- 2nd - Jen

- 3rd - David

# INSPIRATION

- FUN - In a time when everyone is stuck at home etc (covid times)
- Vintage Games - pixel art - old graphics
- Choose your own adventure

# TECH STACK

- Node
- Express
- PSQL

- Axios

- Phaser
- React
- React Spring

# CHALLENGES

- Phaser within React - Using an imperative framework within declaritive framework

- Getting the bones in place before we could move forward - built a proof of concept days before moving into main repo

- DB Design (choose your own adventure - creating different pathways turned out to be much harder than first anticipated)

- ASYNC - creating flow within the game

- Creating mini games within the game

# MAIN FEATURES

- Theme Music
- Choose your own character
- Interactive over-world map - user can control their character
- Choose your own adventure
- Dynamic paths through the storyline - interactive dialogue box
- Collect different badges (player progression)
- Mini-games throughout the story with differing outcomes depending on success
- Alternate endings
- Credits

# HOW WE WORKED AS A TEAM

- We pair programmed a lot of the major challenges together
- We divided and conquered when possible
- We code reviewed every morning to get everyone on the same page
- We had meetings to show each other's work before merging
- This allowed us all to understand the codebase as a whole, while practicing our own skills
- When encountering problems we took them on as a team to work through them
- Available for each other when needed - great communication.
-

# FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS

- More time to build out more paths - richer universe and lore - more adventures to choose from.
- Music/sound for getting a badge?
- Dynamic backgrounds - More background art that scrolls through within each scene
- Bring characters into scenes?
- Adventure Summary - we were implementing this feature - but still needs work.
- Character dialogue (dynamic dialogue) comes from character you choose.
- THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS!
