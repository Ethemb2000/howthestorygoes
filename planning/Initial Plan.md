```
const typewriter = (interval, sentence) => {
  let counter = 0;
  for (const char of sentence) {
    setTimeout(() => {
      process.stdout.write(char);
    }, counter);
    counter += interval;
  }
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log();
  }, counter);
};

typewriter(50, "Be the change you want to see in the world! <3");

module.exports = typewriter;
```

## Stretch

# STORYLINE

- McGuffin - Search for the Sapphire Monkey (Goal)

- Single Character story - potentially different avatars (MVP)

- What is the Sapphire Monkey -

  - Ancient Relic Sapphire Monkey - Legend? Myth?
  - Impending Doom? Returning the Relic to its complete state will save the planet
  - We find sections of the Gem - 3 shards total
  - Once collected they magically become one again
  - We now must return the whole sapphire to the monkey

- Also find easter eggs that are not the gem - random stuff - work with badges

- Collection of hints that lead character to find Sapphire Monkey

## MVP/MVD

- Login to save progress or continue as guest

- Game State
  - Title screen - hit space to begin (sapphire monkey title)
  - Single Character Frame (choose character)
  - Background art - world looks dying - the closer you get to the endgame it becomes more alive
  - Create 5 frames(stops on the map)
  - 3 for the gems, 1 random, 1 endstate
  - Happy Path
